                <p>I became very curious and fascinated about parasites during a stay in Guinea (West Africa). I had a sabbatical from my biology studies to go there. During my stay in Guinea, I fulfilled some volunteer works on a hospital ship. In particular, after I visited a refugee camp, I became very interested in infectious diseases.</p>

                <p>I was astonished to see people who were dying from infections that are curable in my home country, Denmark. But, also, the general lack of knowledge about how infections are transmitted, and thereby also how these diseases could be prevented. Therefore, I did some basic teaching on the use of toilets, hand wash, hygiene, and diarrhoea but also on how to prevent malaria and worm infections. It was here I became ‘hooked on worms’. When I came home to Denmark, I wanted to do my master thesis project on parasitic worms and that has been my research focus since then.</p> 

                <p>What I found very fascinating about these worms was their ability to survive in our body for several years despite being so large that you easily can see them by the naked eye. How can it be possible that our immune system is unable to deal with such large parasites? To be clear about what I mean, when we catch flu, we might have a fever for some days, but then after a week or so our immune system overrides the virus and we recover, and we will not become sick from that type of virus anymore.</p>

                <p>So, given the large size of worms, how they can cause chronic infection for years? It is very interesting but also highly challenging because chronic infections mean morbidity for extended periods. Moreover, as parasitic infections are highly prevalent, infecting more than a billion people, this means that these worms significantly compromise human health.</p>

                <p>During my research, I hope to be able to unlock some of the mechanisms behind worms’ ability to cause chronic infection. Recognition of such a mysterious interaction between host immune system and parasitic worm would be very effective to address how they evade or manipulate our immune system. This in turn may pave the way for identification of pathways resulting in immunosuppression and developing new drugs and vaccines against helminths.</p>
