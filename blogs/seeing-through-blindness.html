                <p>As far as I remember I have always wanted to cure diseases. My first memory dates back to when I was 7 years old, playing pharmacist with my best friend, using old medication boxes from my parent’s cupboard. This desire later matured into wanting to save animals as a veterinarian, to wanting to take care of tiny human souls as a child psychiatrist to ultimately wanting to study medicine to join Doctors without Border... During this period, my father asked the 17-year old me “...and so why would you think they would need you?”. A very pragmatic man, yet probably not very tactful.</p>
                
                <p>Well, he had a point, inexperienced and uneducated as I was, I wouldn’t be much use to anyone at that time. So, I focused my energy on studying. Along the way I was amazed by discovering the field of genetics from a fabulously inspiring life sciences high school teacher and I was further amazed by the latest discoveries of molecular and cellular biology. This kindled my passion even further.</p>
                
                <p>Many years later and after a path that was anything but linear; still driven by the same motivations, I feel that the circle is complete as I get to participate in the effort to tackle a disease that causes blindness in underprivileged populations. I am doing so through research, from the safety and comfort of a research laboratory or in front of my computer. Who would have guessed? Surely not my teenage self! Maybe my dad...</p>

                <p>Over the past years I have become exceedingly more concerned about global health inequalities and have progressively shifted my career focus from basic research on the development of the immune system to the study of infectious diseases of global health importance.</p>
                
                <p>The fact that a child born in a certain area of the world will have a far less chance to survive and live a healthy life than if born in another part of the world revolts me every day. This is where lies my inner motivation to work with pathogens of global health concern.</p>
               
                <p>In my daily research activities, I try to understand why and how Chlamydia trachomatis infects human cells in the eye and destroys them while generating the pathology that we know as blindness. There is a lot that we still don’t understand about Chlamydia trachomatis interactions with its host. There are many open questions:</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled para-list">
                  <li class="color-1">How does Chlamydia trachomatis use the human cell to survive and multiply? </li>
                  <li class="color-1">Why does the bacterium sometimes enters a state of persistence, in other words, hides within the cells and stays quiet? </li>
                  <li class="color-1">Why does Chlamydia trachomatis sometimes causes severe diseases that renders people blind and at other times only induces mild symptoms?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We suspect that this depends on the environment that the bacterium encounters within its host. We also know that other types of Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria can cause other types of diseases if slightly different strains of the same family infect other types of cells within the human body. This last phenomenon is called tropism and I am very curious to find out the reasons behind this phenomenon. In order to answer these questions, I use and combine two different approaches.</p>

                <p>I design experiments in a laboratory trying to reproduce what is happening in the human host with various models using cell lines and mini-organs that we grow in a dish. So-called organoids. The funny singularity of Chlamydia trachomatis is that when the bacterium enters and multiplies in the cells, they start “fizzing”. You can visualise this fast movement of the bacteria enclosed in a double membrane-delimited inclusion within the infected host cells when cells are examined under a microscope. This is quite fascinating to observe!</p>
                <p>One of my latest projects consists of trying to visualise Chlamydia trachomatis with the help of two different fluorescent labels. The objective of this project is that the bacteria can switch on and off a fluorescent signal when we vary the conditions of its environment. We plan to use this “multi-coloured” bacteria in various infection models, specifically organoids, to track infection and understand its progression. I love watching bacteria flicking from green to red through the microscope. I can spend hours and often lose track of time while doing so.</p>

                <p>In parallel to this approach, we use precious information that is stored within the genetic material of the bacteria and that we access through sequencing its DNA. That information gives us a snapshot summary of all the genes that a bacterium contains. When correlating this information to the characteristics and behaviours that we observe and measure in our laboratory tests, we can better understand which genes are responsible for virulence, in other words why a bacterium causes disease or which genes are involved in persistence for example.</p>

                <p>Another very important area of our research is to collect clinical samples harvested from patients suffering from trachoma living in different parts of the world. The sequencing of the genome of these bacteria contained in the samples allows us to better understand which mechanisms underlie the evolution of the bacteria as well as its transmission mode. We use bioinformatics tools to measure the diversity of the genome of the different bacteria. Thanks to these tools we can reconstitute the equivalent of the genealogical tree of the bacteria and the history of how it has evolved.</p>

                <p>Through these methods, we have recently identified that genes or regions of the genome can get exchanged between different strains of Chlamydia trachomatis causing the different types of disease. This has wide implications on how to treat and prevent the infections.</p>

                <p>I love my work because it offers me the opportunity to create a positive impact in the long term about a neglected tropical disease, a disease asymmetrically affecting underprivileged populations. Knowing more about the biology of this bacteria and its diversity will contribute toward defining more effective health policies to tackle this disease and shaping the best strategy for investing in trachoma eradication efforts.</p>
