                <p>I was looking at a pandemic on a plate. Let me explain.</p>

                <p>In January of 1991, one of the largest cholera epidemics in modern history began in Peru. The epidemic quickly spread across all of Latin America, leading to over 1.4 million cases and over 10 thousand deaths. By the mid-2000s nearly all countries affected were cholera free.</p>

                <p>Cholera returned to the region in dramatic fashion in Haiti, in 2010, after a large earthquake devastated the island. At the time, this was the largest epidemic in modern history. Haiti continues to battle with cholera even today, where the epidemic has affected nearly 1 million people, and 10 thousand people have lost their lives.</p> 

                <p>There has been quite a bit of confusion as to how and why the 1991 epidemic broke out in Peru. Most of the discussion is around whether the strain responsible was local to the Americas or if it was imported from somewhere else. To help answer this question, we needed to gather a collection of strains from across Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

                <p>To that end, I traveled to Buenos Aires with Matthew Dorman (a PhD student in our group) to spend a few weeks at the Malbrán Institute, which houses the national microbiology reference laboratories for Argentina. The Malbrán also serves as a “hub” for Latin America where many of the cholera samples from across the region are sent. Plus, we have some fantastic friends and collaborators from there, such as Josefina Campos, who was our host for trip.</p>

                <p>While at the Malbrán we worked on a collection of ~500 cholera isolates ranging from the 1990s through the present. We needed to grow the bacteria from storage and then extract the DNA to send back to the Sanger Institute where we can place them into our global phylogenetic tree in order to understand how these isolates were related to each other. It was during this work that I had the full realization that the tiny microbes on these petri dishes literally represented millions of cholera cases and had taken so many lives.</p>

                <p>The isolates from Argentina and our other collaborators across Latin America (especially UNAM in Mexico) allowed us to trace the origins of the 1991 epidemic to a strain circulating in West/Central Africa in the late 1980s. We also were able to show that local strains do cause sporadic, low incidence, outbreaks across the region, but these are vastly different than that of epidemic cholera. You can read more about it <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6364/789" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Although we were working hard (of course!), we took time to enjoy being in such an amazing city and experience Argentine culture. This mostly took the form of food and drink, which was totally fine with me! We feasted on incredible steak, Malbec wine, and irresistibly delicious empanadas.</p>

                <p>While our work on cholera and other NTDs allows us to travel to incredible places and experience other cultures, it is a bit bitter sweet in that we are there because large health crisis have happened or are occurring. Cholera continues to affect some of the world’s most vulnerable populations. The current situation in Yemen serves as a painful reminder of that fact. By understanding how cholera has historically moved through populations and across continents, we can use this information to better inform how we prioritize and implement control strategies.</p>
