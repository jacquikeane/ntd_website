              <h3>Guinea worm disease</h3>
              <p class="aboutP2 text-justify">Guinea worm is a large nematode (or round) worm that causes the disease known as guinea worm disease or dracunculiasis. Adult females, the stage that causes the disease, can be up to 1m long. The disease is now restricted to four countries in sub-saharan Africa, but as the scientific name for guinea worm – <em>Dracunculus medinensis</em>, meaning ‘little dragon of Medina’  – suggests, it was once far more widespread. Guinea worm is rather unusual, and is almost unrelated to other human parasites, as a very distant relative of the filarial worms that cause diseases like elephantiasis and river blindness.</p>

            <div class="diseaseSection">
              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-1">What is the disease?</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Often the first sign of infection is when a intensely painful blister appears, usually on the legs or feet, caused by the female worm.  The blister grows over a few days to several centimetres in diameter before bursting to form an ulcer, through which the female worm emerges. The burning sensation caused by the emerging worm leads people to immerse their limbs in cold water; this bathing encourages the worm to emerge and expel larvae, which can then infect water fleas, the next host in the parasites life cycle. People remain incapacitated for 70-100 days as the worm slowly emerges. The presence of an open wound means that secondary infections with bacteria are very common where healthcare is not available, and much of the disability is due to these infections. While fatalities are fairly rare, permanent disability occurred in almost 1% of cases in the few available studies.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-5">Who does it affect?</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Luckily, Guinea worm now affects almost nobody! It is now restricted to Ethiopia, South Sudan, Chad and Mali; in 2016 there were only 25 confirmed cases discovered by a very extensive surveillance network, including financial rewards for reported cases.  Unfortunately, there were also over 1,000 infections reported in dogs in these countries – almost all in Chad. Historically it was an important parasite of mankind and as recently as 1986 there were over 3 million cases of Guinea worm in 22 countries. It was locally extremely common: a study in a group of villages in Western Nigeria in 1966 reported that over half of adults were infected in that year alone.</p>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-2">Life cycle / how is it spread?</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Guinea worm disease was classically thought to be spread only through drinking water contaminated with water fleas (various species of <em>Cyclops</em> – a microscopic crustacean) that themselves are infected with the larvae of <em>Dracunculus></em>. There is some evidence that larvae can also survive in so-called paratenic hosts (hosts in which a parasite can survive but do not reproduce or develop further) such as fish and frogs: it is thought that these hosts may be responsible for the rise of cases in animals.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-4">How can we hope to prevent-stop the disease?</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify"Considering that Guinea worm was such an important human pathogen, we do not know very much about the basic biology of the parasite. It is distantly related to other human parasites, known as filarial worms, that are spread by biting insects, but this relationship is very distant, so what we know about these other nematodes probably doesn’t tell us very much. We have generated a reference genome assembly as part of a larger project comparing the genomes of many parasitic worms, so this will at least preserve some information about this fascinating parasite after its deliberate extinction by the Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP).</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Increasing the availability of clean drinking water, including through providing portable filters in remote areas that still lack piped water or wells, has been the main method for reducing the number of guinea worm cases. The other method has been to quickly identify cases and ensure the larvae from the emerging female don’t reach rivers or lakes, by not immersing the blister in such places. The long incubation time (around 1 year) makes it a slow and difficult process to contain the last remaining cases. There is no drug or vaccine known to be effective against Guinea worm, although products developed to treat the filarial nematode heartworm in dogs are being trialled in an attempt to control dog infections in Chad.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-3">How do we use pathogen material to do research?</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">We have sequenced the genomes of parasites collected from both dog infections and human cases, and used these data to show that both dog- and human-infecting worms come from the same population of parasites, so there is the potential for worms emerging from dogs to produce new human cases. We now hope to directly demonstrate transmission in each direction, and make some estimate of how often It happens, by reconstructing the pedigree of the worms from genomic data.</p>
