              <h3>Guinea worm disease</h3>
              <p class="aboutP2 text-justify">Guinea worm disease (GWD), or dracunculiasis, is caused by a large nematode known as a Guinea worm (GW).  Often the first sign of infection is when an intensely painful blister appears, usually on the legs or feet.  The blister is caused by the female worm, which can reach 1m in length.  The blister grows to several centimetres across before bursting to form an ulcer, through which the female worm emerges. The burning sensation caused by the worm emerging leads people to immerse their limbs in cold water; this bathing encourages the worm to emerge and expel larvae, which can then infect water fleas, the next host in the parasites life cycle.</p> 

              <p class="aboutP2 text-justify">People remain incapacitated for 70-100 days as the worm slowly emerges. The presence of an open wound means that secondary infections with bacteria are very common where healthcare is not available; much of the disability is due to these infections. Fatalities are fairly rare, but permanent disability occurred in almost 1% of cases in the few available studies.</p>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-5">Who it affects</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Historically it was an important parasite of mankind and as recently as 1986 there were over 3 million cases of GW in 22 countries.  Luckily, thanks to efforts from the Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP), GW now affects almost nobody! It is now restricted to Ethiopia, South Sudan, Chad and Mali. As the scientific name for GW – <em>Dracunculus medinensis</em>, meaning ‘little dragon of Medina’ – suggests, it was once far more widespread. In 2016 there were only 25 confirmed cases in people, but over 1,000 infections in dogs were reported.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-2">How it is spread</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">GWD was classically thought to be spread only by drinking water contaminated with water fleas that are infected with the larvae of <em>Dracunculus</em>. There is some evidence that larvae can also survive in so-called paratenic hosts (hosts in which a parasite can survive but not reproduce or develop further) such as fish and frogs: these paratenic hosts may be responsible for the rise of cases in animals.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-4">Stopping the disease</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Increasing the availability of clean drinking water, by providing portable filters in remote areas that lack piped water or wells, has been the main method for reducing the number of GW cases. The other method has been to quickly identify cases and ensure the larvae from the emerging female don’t reach rivers or lakes (by not immersing the blister in rivers or lakes). The long incubation time (around 1 year from infection to emergence of the female worm) makes it difficult to contain the last remaining cases. No drug or vaccine is known to be effective against GW, although products developed to treat a heartworm in dogs are being trialled in an attempt to control dog infections in Chad.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-3">Using pathogen material to do research</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">By analysing the genomes of parasites collected from both dog infections and human cases, we have shown that both dog- and human-infecting worms come from the same population of parasites. Crucially, this means there is potential for worms emerging from dogs to produce new human cases. We now hope to directly demonstrate transmission in each direction, and make some estimate of how often It happens, by reconstructing the pedigree of the worms from genomic data.</p>
