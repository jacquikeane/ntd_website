              <h3>Schistosomiasis</h3>
              <p class="aboutP2 text-justify">Schistosomiasis, or bilharzia, is caused by parasitic worms called Schistosomes. It affects more than 200 million people worldwide. Schistosomes are trematode flatworms known as blood flukes. There are separate male and female worms genetically determined, unlike the rest of trematodes, which are hermaphrodites.  They parasitise mammals, such as humans and livestock, but also go through an intermediate snail host.</p>

              <p class="aboutP2 text-justify">The eggs released by the females get trapped in different host tissues, driving the pathology of the infection. Gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts are affected, leading to liver, spleen and pelvic organ diseases, plus other complications including abnormal accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, haemorrhage, bladder cancer, infertility and increased risk of transmission of HIV-1, depending of the schistosome species.</p>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-1">Who it affects</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">It is distributed mainly in the most impoverished areas of the globe but in 2014 an outbreak of urogenital schistosomiasis was reported in Corsica, France. As the intermediate host for <em>S. haematobium</em> is present along the Mediterranean coast, the infection could eventually spread into continental Europe.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-5">How it is spread</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Infected freshwater snails release swimming larvae called cercariae that infect humans by penetrating the skin. Once in mammals, the parasite migrates in the blood to the liver and mature in the portal system, male and female worms mate, and migrate to mesenteric veins or veins draining the urogenital system, depending on the species. Female worms lay hundreds of eggs each day, which migrate into the lumen of the intestine (<em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> and <em>S. japonicum</em>) or the bladder (<em>S. haematobium</em>), being excreted in the faeces or urine, respectively. The egg hatches on contact with water, releasing a free-living larva called miracidium that infects the freshwater snail, and then undergoes successive cycles of asexual multiplication. Four weeks after infecting the snail, infectious cercariae, that swim in search of the definitive mammal host, are released.</p>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-4">Stopping the disease</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Schistosomiasis, a relatively easy infection to treat with an effective drug, Praziquantel, is extremely difficult to control. The drug does not prevent reinfection, which happens when individuals come into contact with contaminated water.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The main areas to consider for controlling the disease are:</p>
                <ol class="text-justify">
                  <li>Proper sanitation and education,</li>
                  <li>Molluscicides,</li>
                  <li>Discovery of new drugs and development of vaccines to prevent the reinfection.</li>
                </ol>
              <p class="text-justify">The study of the genome and transcriptome of this parasite may unravel vulnerabilities that can be exploited to address point (iii).</p>
              </div>
              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-3">Using pathogen material to do research</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Even though the parasite life cycle and the disease were described over one hundred years ago, there is still a huge gap in the knowledge of the basic biology and interactions between the parasite and the host. In 2009, the complete genomes of <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> and <em>S. japonicum</em> were published, followed by <em>S. haematobium</em> 3 years later. High throughput gene expression studies from developmental stages are also available on <a href="http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Smansoni" target="_blank">GeneDB</a> and <a href="https://parasite.wormbase.org/index.html" target="_blank">WormBase ParaSite</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">In our Parasite Genomics laboratory at the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk" target="_blank">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI)</a> we have set up the complete life cycle of <em>S. mansoni</em>, breeding a colony of susceptible freshwater snails to access all developmental stages. We can isolate parasite biomolecules, e.g. nucleic acids and proteins, and functional approaches are being developed to understand the role of genes relevant for parasite development or important in the interaction with the host. The role of host genes during the infection is also analyzed by employing a murine model of the disease.</p>
