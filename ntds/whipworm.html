              <h3>Whipworm</h3>
              <p class="aboutP2 text-justify"Whipworms are a type of intestinal parasitic nematode (round worms) that live in the caecum and large intestine of their mammal hosts, where they tunnel through gut lining cells. There are several species of whipworm. <em>Trichuris trichiura</em> causes the disease trichuriasis in humans. <em>T. muris</em> infects mice and closely mirrors the infection in humans, so it is used as a model to study trichuriasis.</p>

              <p class="text-justify">Trichuriasis is a major NTD infecting around 700 million people in the tropics and subtropics. It causes abdominal pain, gut inflammation and Trichuris dysentery syndrome including chronic diarrhoea and anaemia. A heavy infection can cause intestinal obstruction and rectal prolapse. Trichuriasis has been linked to malnutrition and physical and cognitive developmental problems.</p>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-5">Who it affects</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Trichuriasis affects mainly children from low and middle-income countries in Asia, Africa and South America. Due to the effect on childrenâ€™s mental and physical development, the disease impedes cognitive development and education. This can have chronic socio-economic consequences, limiting agricultural and economic productivity in the affected countries. This completes a vicious cycle, whereby poverty and poor sanitation produce ideal conditions for the transmission of the disease.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-2">How it is spread</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Adult whipworms live in the caecum at the top of the large intestine where they produce thousands of microscopic uninfective (un-embryonated) eggs each day. The eggs are passed in the faeces. In areas where there is a lack of adequate toilet sanitation, the eggs contaminate the soil and surrounding environment. After 15-30 days in the warm and moist environment of the tropics and subtropics, a tiny parasitic larva develops inside the egg, causing it to become infective (embryonated).</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Infection with whipworms occurs upon ingestion food or water, or from hands, that are contaminated with whipworm eggs from the environment. In the caecum the larvae hatch from the eggs and burrow through the gut lining. In the gut lining the larvae develop until they become adults and the cycle begins again when these adults produce eggs. Female worms in the caecum shed between 3,000 and 20,000 eggs per day. The life span of the adults is about 1 year.</p>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-4">Stopping the disease</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">To prevent and stop trichuriasis we need to:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Treat infected people with drugs like albendozole and mebendazole. Unfortunately, these drugs are not completely effective.</li>
                  <li>Change poor sanitation practices by building toilets and promoting their proper use and safe management of the faecal waste.</li>
                  <li>Provide safe water supply.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="text-justify">We also need to educate:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Sanitation and personal hygiene (e.g handwashing with soap before meals, face washing reduces transmission through contaminated hands).</li>
                  <li>Wash, peel, or cook raw vegetables and fruits before eating.</li>
                  <li>Discourage thumb sucking and nail biting in children.</li>
                </o5l>
              </div>
              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-3">Using pathogen material to do research</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">At the WTSI, we use genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and microscopy, to investigate early interactions between whipworm and the host gut lining during invasion and establishment of infection.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">We use different models:</p>
                <ol class="text-justify">
                  <li>In vivo model using <em>T. muris</em> infection of mice.</li>
                  <li>In vitro model using miniguts (3D cell clusters generated from gut tissue that have similar characteristics and function to the gut) of mouse or human origin and microinjecting them with <em>T. muris</em> or <em>T. trichiura</em> larvae, respectively.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="text-justify">Annotation of the genome and transcriptomics data help to identify genes coding for proteins important during infection and disease. This knowledge will help to develop vaccines and discover new treatments to fight whipworm infections.</p>
