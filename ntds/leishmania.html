              <h3>Leishmaniasis</h3>
              <p class="aboutP2 text-justify"><em>Leishmania</em> is a group of parasitic protozoa - microscopic, single-celled pathogens that cause human diseases. Around 20 different species of <em>Leishmania</em> are associated with rather different diseases, so we often refer to a set of diseases – the leishmaniases.</p>

              <p class="aboutP2 text-justify">Many (perhaps most) <em>Leishmania</em> infections cause no identifiable disease at all – called asymptomic infections. Some infections lead to cutaneous leishmaniasis, often with relatively mild skin plaques and ulcers that heal without treatment.  Other infections cause more serious and long-lasting skin ulcers and other syndromes, such as multiple skin lesions across the body.  A serious disease (mucocutaneous leishmaniasis) can develop, where the immune response to the parasite leads to extensive skin and mucosal tissue damage, resulting in permanent, highly disfiguring destruction of the mouth, nose and palate; secondary infections following this damage can be fatal. Infections with some species can spread to deeper tissue, such as the liver and spleen, causing visceral leishmaniasis, a generally fatal disease.</p> 

              <p class="aboutP2 text-justify">Unlike viruses or bacteria, protozoa have large, complex cells more similar to plant or animal cells. They are part of a wider group of protozoa, the kinetoplastids, with which they share a great deal of very unusual – and fascinating – biology such as a unique way they read DNA to make proteins and a unique cellular structure.</p>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-5">Who it affects</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Leishmaniasis affects the poorest people in some of the poorest parts of the world. Possibly as many as 1 million people suffer from cutaneous leishmaniasis and more than 200,000 people with visceral disease. Visceral leishmaniasis is concentrated in just a few regions: North-East India and neighbouring countries, Brazil and four countries in East Africa: Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is more widespread, with cases occurring in South and Central America, North Africa, the middle East and central Asia.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-2">How it is spread</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Leishmaniasis is spread by different species of biting flies called sandflies. Different <em>Leishmania</em> species are associated with different sandfly species that prefer to bite different mammals. explaining much of the variation in host range between the various parasite species. The key visceral leishmaniasis species, L. donovani, apparently has no animal reservoir and only occurs in humans, but other <em>Leishmania</em> do infect animal species too. For example, dogs are important in the spread of visceral leishmaniasis in many regions and rodents help to spread many cutaneous <em>Leishmania</em> species in the old world. Cutaneous leishmaniasis parasites in South America infect a wide range of wildlife, with human infections particularly common in people living or working in the rainforest.</p>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-4">Stopping the disease</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Ongoing efforts to control leishmaniasis are particularly focused on visceral leishmaniaisis, one of the diseases targeted for control by 2020 under the London declaration on neglected tropical disease. All of the available drugs for leishmaniasis are too toxic to be used in a community-wide preventative treatment approach, so the main strategy being adopted for this disease is improved detection and early treatment to prevent patients from passing the disease on. This effort is supported by attempts to reduce the population of the sandfly populations by spraying long-lasting insecticide onto house walls in endemic areas.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">The <a href=href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk" target="_blank">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI)</a> has a long history of involvement in understanding the genomes of Leishmania parasites, having been involved in producing the first reference genome major, made public in 2005.</p>
                <p  class="text-justify">Two major research projects on <em>Leishmania</em> are being done at WTSI:</p>
                <ol class="text-justify">
                  <li>understanding the evolution and diversity of <em>Leishmania</em> by generating whole-genome sequence data from large-scale collections of parasites (including both human cases of disease and animal reservoirs)</li>
                  <li>identifying <em>Leishmania</em> proteins that might contribute to a protective vaccine for human visceral leishmaniasis</li>
