              <h3>Leishmania</h3>
              <p class="aboutP2 text-justify"><em>Leishmania</em> is a group of parasitic protozoa - microscopic, single-celled pathogens. Unlike viruses or bacteria, protozoa have large, complex cells more similar to plant or animal cells. They are part of a wider group of protozoa, the kinetoplastids, with which they share a great deal of very unusual – and fascinating – biology such as a unique way they read DNA to make proteins and a unique cellular structure. Two different kinetoplastid groups – <em>Leishmania</em> and the trypanosomes – cause major neglected tropical diseases. Trypanosomes cause sleeping sickness in sub-saharan Africa and Chagas’ disease in the new world.</p>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-1">What is the disease?</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Around 20 different species of <em>Leishmania</em> cause human diseases. The different species are associated with rather different diseases, so we often refer to a set of diseases – the leishmaniases. The results of <em>Leishmania</em> infection can vary enormously.  Many (and perhaps most) infections cause no identifiable disease at all – called asymptomic infections. Some infections lead to relatively mild skin plaques and ulcers that heal without treatment.  Other infections cause more serious and long-lasting skin ulcers and other syndromes, such as multiple skin lesions across the body.  A serious disease (mucocutaneous leishmaniasis) can also develop, where the immune response to the parasite leads to extensive skin and mucosal tissue damage, resulting in permanent, highly disfiguring destruction of the mouth, nose and palate; secondary infections following this damage can be fatal. Infections with some species can also spread to deeper tissue, principally the liver and spleen and cause visceral leishmaniasis, a generally fatal disease. </p>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-5">Who does it affect?</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Leishmaniasis affects the poorest people in some of the poorest parts of the world. Estimates vary, but there are perhaps as many as 1 million people with cutaneous leishmaniasis and more than 200,000 people with visceral disease. Visceral leishmaniasis is concentrated in just a few regions: North-East India and neighbouring countries, Brazil and four countries in East Africa: Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is more widespread, with cases occurring in South and Central America, North Africa, the middle East and central Asia.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-2">Life cycle / how is it spread?</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">Leishmaniasis is spread by different species of biting flies called sandflies. Different <em>Leishmania</em> species are associated with different sandfly species that prefer to bite different mammals. explaining much of the variation in host range between the various parasite species. The key visceral leishmaniasis pathogen, <em>L. donovani</em>, apparently has no animal reservoir and only occurs in humans, but other <em>Leishmania</em> do infect animal species too. For example, dogs are important in the spread of visceral leishmaniasis in many regions and rodents help to spread many cutaneous <em>Leishmania</em> species in the old world. Cutaneous leishmaniasis parasites in South America infect a wide range of wildlife, with human infections particularly common in people living or working in the rainforest.</p>

              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-4">How can we hope to prevent-stop the disease?</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify"><em>Leishmania</em> themselves are well-known parasites with a fairly extensive community of researchers interested in understanding them better. A related parasite, <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em> (that causes sleeping sickness in sub-Saharan Africa) is something of a laboratory model for understanding some aspects of cell and molecular biology. That is because this group of parasites have many unique features in the way their cells and genomes are organised, making them a source of endless fascination to many biologists interested in these topics, completely independently of their role as important human pathogens.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">The ongoing efforts to control leishmaniasis is particularly focused on visceral leishmaniaisis, which is one of the diseases targeted for control by 2020 under the London declaration on neglected tropical disease. All of the available drugs for leishmaniasis are too toxic to be used in a community-wide preventative treatment approach, so the main strategy being adopted for this disease is improved case detection and early treatment to prevent patients from passing the disease on. This effort is supported by attempts to reduce the vector population, by spraying long-lasting insecticide onto house walls in endemic areas.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="diseaseHeader bg-color-3">How do we use pathogen material to do research?</div>
              <div class="diseaseDetails">
                <p class="text-justify">The Sanger Institute has a long history of involvement in understanding the genomes of trypanosomatid parasites, having been involved in producing the first reference genomes for <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em> and <em>Leishmania major</em> that were made public in 2005. There are two major ongoing research projects on <em>Leishmania</em>: one focuses on understanding the evolution and diversity of these parasites by generating whole-genome sequence data from large-scale collections of parasites from human cases of disease and animal reservoirs. A second is attempting to identify Leishmania proteins that might contribute to a protective vaccine for human visceral leishmaniasis.</p>
